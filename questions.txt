Questions / Gaps to ask the product team : 

1. Threshold rule granularity
Is low_stock_threshold per product, per product+warehouse, or per product type? Should warehouses override product-level thresholds?

2. Definition of "recent sales activity"
How many days should "recent" cover (30/60/90)? Does this include pending orders?

3. Units & conversions
Are there units of measure and conversions (kg, piece, box)? Are BOMs needed?

4. Multi-tenancy / ownership
Can multiple companies share the same product entry (same SKU)? Or is every product created by a company? (We assumed SKU global.)

5. Reservations & backorders
Should reserved stock / fulfilling orders reduce available stock? How to treat allocated vs available?

6. Transfers between warehouses
Should we model transfers as inventory_movements(reason='transfer')? Any special rules?

7. Supplier selection rules
How to pick supplier for reordering (cheapest vs preferred vs shortest lead time)?

8. Perishable / lot / serial tracking
Do we need batch/lot/expiry tracking or serialized inventory?

9. Currency & pricing
Multi-currency support? Pricing per company or global?

10. Performance SLAs
Expected scale (#products, #warehouses, read/writes per minute)? This affects indexing and partitioning choices.
